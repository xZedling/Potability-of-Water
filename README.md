# Water Bodies Classification with Machine Learning

This project aims to classify water bodies using various machine learning algorithms. The provided Jupyter notebook implements seven different machine learning models and evaluates their performance using accuracy metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains features related to water bodies and their classification labels. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in machine learning algorithms.

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models have been implemented in the Jupyter notebook along with their corresponding accuracy scores:

1. Logistic Regression: 0.53
2. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN): 0.80
3. Decision Tree: 0.81
4. Random Forest: 0.89
5. AdaBoost: 0.73
6. XGBoost: 0.84

Additionally, two more models have been evaluated with the following accuracy scores:

1. **Bagging Classifier**: 0.66
2. **XGBoost (repeated)**: 0.66

## Getting Started

To run the Jupyter notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-bodies-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
